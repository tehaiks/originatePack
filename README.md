# webSpring-Vue
Simple boilerplate for performant web apps. For me, it was a good way to start messing with SPA. Based on Webpack(v1 - with Babel Support), Vue 2.0, Vuex, jQuery, and LESS. It includes Bulma front-end framework for fast prototyping.

## Usage

Install using preferred dependency manager.

`npm install`
OR
`yarn install`

Then init webpack in watchmode, to start live reload server:

`webpack --watch`

Source files are located in `src` directory.
