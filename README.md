# webSpring-Vue
Simple boilerplate for performant web apps. For me, it was a good way to start messing a bit more with Vuex. Based on Webpack(v1 - with Babel Support), Vue 2.0, Vuex, jQuery, and LESS. It includes Bulma front-end framework for fast prototyping.

## Usage

Install using preferred dependency manager.

`npm install`

OR

`yarn install`

Init webpack to bulid app in `/dist` folder

`webpack`

OR

Fire webpack in watchmode, to start live reload server: 

`webpack --watch`
